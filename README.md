Fracture Detection Using X-ray Images with 3D Visualization is an innovative project that combines the power of machine learning with advanced medical imaging techniques to enhance the accuracy of fracture detection. The project involves the classification of X-ray images into two categories: 'fractured' and 'not fractured'.

Key features of this project include:
1.Data Preparation:
X-ray images are divided into training and test datasets stored in dedicated folders.
Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalisation, and augmentation improve model performance.

2.Machine Learning Model:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for fracture classification.
Model predictions are further validated using metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix.

3.3D Visualization:
X-ray images are converted from 2D grayscale to 3D representations, enabling enhanced visual interpretation.
Model predictions are overlaid on the 3D visualizations, clearly indicating whether a fracture is detected.

4.Applications:
The solution can assist radiologists and orthopaedic professionals in accurate and fast diagnosis.
This approach enhances interpretability and provides deeper insights into the nature and severity of fractures.


With its combination of AI-driven classification and 3D visualization techniques, this project represents a step toward integrating technology into medical diagnostics for improved patient outcomes.
